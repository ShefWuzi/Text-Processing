# Text-Processing
Text Processing Course Work

## Document Retrieval Assignment
Implementation of different information retrieval algorithms
  - Binary 
  - Term Frequency
  - Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency


## Huffman Compression Assignment
Implementation of Huffman Compression for text file compression
- Used pickle library to store word-binary mapping in binary file format
- Huffman coding was does with 2 methods
  - character-based => Symbols were on character basis
  - word-based => Symbols were on word basis
  
## lab 3 - Implementation of Zipf's law
 There actually isn't much to say with regards to this.
 
 Unless you want to know what Zipf's law is then:
 
 ### Zipf's law 
 Zipfâ€™s  law  is  an  empirical  law  formulated  by  the  American  linguist  George  Kingsley  Zipf.   Itstates  that  in  a  large  corpus,  the  frequency  of  any  word  is  inversely  proportional  to  its  rankin the frequency table.  Thus the most frequent word will occur approximately twice as oftenas the second most frequent word,  three times as often as the third most frequent word,  etc.In the Brown Corpus, for example, the most common word (the) accounts for nearly 7% of allword occurrences, the second (of) for 3.5%, and so on. 
 
 ^^ I took this from the lab PDF
 
## lab 4 - Regular expressions
Basically learning how to use regular expressions. 
- Built a basic HTML Parser using regex.
